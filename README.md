ML pipeline for depression analysis
# Depression Analysis via Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository presents a machine learning pipeline aimed at analyzing depression-related datasets. The primary goal is to provide insights into mental health indicators, perform preprocessing, and implement supervised learning methods to predict relevant outcomes.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw mental health data
- Explore statistical properties and feature distributions
- Build predictive models to identify depression trends
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

## Technologies

This project is implemented in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

## Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for exploration and modeling
- `models/`: Trained models and related artifacts
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and evaluation

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahdi-abdollahi76/depression_ML.git
